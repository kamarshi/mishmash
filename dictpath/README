Problem: Take two dictionary -legal words and find the shortest path
from one to the other.  Each transition should include changing one
character only and the resulting word should be a dictionary-legal
word.  Log the pathway from first to second word.

Argument: a breadth first search will uncover the shortest pathway
from first string to second
